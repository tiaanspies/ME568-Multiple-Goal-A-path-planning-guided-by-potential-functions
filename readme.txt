The program effieciently finds a path from any starting position to a suitable parking spot for a car parking problem. The aim is to generate a "non-holomonic like" path without being nearly as computationally expensive. The path can then be used to bias a real non-holonomic path finding algorithm. More information is shown in the report PDF. Read "Multiple Goal A path planning guided by potential functions.pdf" for a detailed explanation on the algorithm.

Note: The program is derived from an A* algorithm used in BU ME568 written by Prof. Tron. My contribution is adding multiple goal capability with potential fields for the path biasing.
